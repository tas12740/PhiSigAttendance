        Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity is a gender-inclusive fraternity open to undergraduate students attending
        four-year colleges and universities throughout the United States. Our purpose is to bring together some of the
        brightest and most motivated students on campus and work together in a spirit of excellence to encourage three
        ideals:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="list">The acquisition and dissemination of information, knowledge, and skills through
            <b>scholarship.</b>
        </li>
        <li class="list">The application of professional skills and the fostering of <b>leadership</b> qualities by
            promoting and advancing the welfare of humanity.</li>
        <li class="list">The fostering of intentional, inclusive fraternal <b>fellowship</b> within our ranks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Collectively, these three ideals are known as <b>the Tripod</b> of Phi Sigma Pi. Joining Phi Sigma Pi is the
        first step in a lifelong journey of increased awareness, improved capabilities, greater opportunities, and a
        network of friendships.
