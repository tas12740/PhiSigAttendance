        <h3>About Committees</h3>

        <p>
            Committees are an essential part of the structure of Phi Sigma Pi. The Vice President leads the committee
            system
            and presides over committee Chairs. In order to foster the development of leadership and to facilitate the
            running of our chapter, all siblings without leadership positions must serve on one of Alpha Kappaâ€™s twelve
            committees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of the committees is led by one or two chairs, who are elected by the chapter each semester. The
            committees
            are given budgets which allow them the freedom to coordinate and make events such as Mountain Weekend,
            skills
            trainings, or Formal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Siblings are not bound to a committee for their entire time in PSP; the system allows siblings the ability
            to
            try new things and pique new interests each semester.

            <p class="img">
                Alumni Committee serves as a liaison between current members of PSP and siblings that have graduated.
                Alumni
                Committee makes sure that alumni stay well-informed of major events that occur in the Fraternity. It
                establishes a link between generations so that alumni can still actively participate even when they have
                graduated.
            </p>
            <p class="img">
                Alumni Committee holds one big event every semester. In the fall, we host the Alumni Tailgate, which
                usually
                falls on Homecoming weekend, when many alumni will already be in Chapel Hill. In the spring, we host
                the Senior Roast, which is a final farewell to all the senior Siblings.

            <p>
                The Fundraising Committee works to both raise funds for the Fraternity and facilitate merchandise orders
                for
                Siblings. Examples of past fundraisers include Kendra Scott, Lotsa, and Benny Cappella's.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Committee's mission is to raise money for the general activities and budgets of the fraternity as
                well
                as to provide opportunities for financial relief for siblings experiencing financial difficulties.
                Fundraising is also actively working to lower the costs of merchandise and to make the fraternity more
                financially accessible for all Siblings and Potential New Members.

            <p>
                From managing our social media accounts to advertising our various events throughout the semester, PR
                committee's goal is to bridge the gap between PSP and the campus community. PR works closely with
                Recruitment but is always looking for more ideas on how to represent PSP year-round. Check out PSP on
                our social media, linked below or on the home page!

            <img src="{% static 'root/img/committees/scholarship.PNG' %}">
            <p class="img">
                The scholarship Committee is a platform for siblings to share their passions with the Fraternity and
                upholds
                our philosophy of "lifelong learning".
            </p>
            <p class="img">
                Scholarship Committee is dedicated to the ideal of scholarship within the classroom; however, academic
                success is only a small part of embodying this ideal! The Scholarship Committee strives to provide
                Siblings
                with opportunities that will help us grow intellectually but also socially and culturally.

            <img src="{% static 'root/img/committees/service.jpg' %}">
            <p class="img">
                The Service Committee is dedicated to bringing the Fraternity together on projects that
                support the local community. Our biggest annual event is our involvement in Special Olympics, which
                takes
                place in the Spring. This event brings together kids with disabilities while also raising awareness
                about
                issues concerning disabilities.
            </p>
            <p class="img">
                The Service Committee will also hold various other activities and events that support local charities as
                well as the Chapel Hill community as a whole. Service is a great way to form fellowship among the
                siblings
                while also making a positive impact.
