    <p id="head-p">Dear Phi Sig:</p>
    <p>
        I’ve sat down several times to do this now, and each time the words that I have in my head just don’t come out
        onto the page. But none of that came out quite right, so this time I’ll just speak from the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
        Phi Sig, to me, has always been about the people. It is the people I met on a trip to see the solar eclipse
        (which, wildly enough to me, happened while many of you were still in high school) that convinced me to jump out
        of my comfort zone and go to an interest meeting. (You could also argue I was just following Adam because I had
        no ability to go out and do my own thing and, while that’s savage, it’s probably true, though I digress.) It was
        Cat, who was the first stranger I ever met to make me friend them on Snapchat, and Matt, who everyone kept
        making jokes about, and Wade, this strange old man who for some reason was tagging along with a bunch of college
        kids, who were Adam’s fam but would become my fam. These people would give me an introduction to the group of
        people who have changed my life. The people I have met in Phi Sig have expanded my perspective, helped me to
        think about the world in different ways, made me more intentional, and taught me more about life and love than
        they could ever know. It is these people that have formed the foundation of my college experience, and with whom
        I’ve made so many incredible memories. So, to the Best Damn Fam Phi Sig has to offer (Matt, Micah, Wade, Cat,
        Michael, Brooks, Maris, Adam, Sarah V., Maggie, Evan, Michelle, Sarah S., Tori, Anna P., Abby, Grace, Vignesh,
        Anna H., and, of course, my two wonderful littles, Katie and Emily) and the many, many others (among whom Libby
        and the greatest class ever, the Beta Zetas, deserve special shoutouts) in Phi Sig who have touched my soul and
        made these years to remember: thank you for making me the person I am today. You gave me a community and a place
        on campus, and I will forever be grateful for that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Phi Sig at its heart is caught in a crisis of never knowing what exactly it is. What attracted me to it was that
        it seemed like this place that offered a route into so many different things, whether it be doing service or
        learning new things, all while offering a close-knit social community. It’s not merely a one-dimensional place.
        At the same time, I always tell PNMs that Phi Sig can be what you put into it. It has become my primary “thing”
        on campus, and I have chosen to dedicate my free time and energy to it, but it does not have to be that for
        everyone. It has given me things to put on my resume, allowed me to give back to my community, and taught me
        such varied things as salsa dancing and painting. It has, as I’ve said, given me friends and a community to last
        a lifetime. However, what Phi Sig sometimes fails to do is to distinguish between these various missions. Is it
        a primarily social organization which strikes out into the realms of service and scholarship? Is it an
        organization with higher goals that also allows its siblings to form a community and connections? I believe that
        it can be all of the above: a place for people to find a community of different people which allows them to grow
        by giving them opportunities to learn new things, serve their local community, and become leaders, all while
        meeting fantastic new people. It can be a place for people like me, who needed a place on campus, to be their
        thing and allow them to give back to it in turn, but it can also be an auxiliary piece to round out students and
        their college experiences. It is, however, no longer my place, and it’s up to you all to shape Phi Sig into the
        place you want it to be.
    </p>

    <p>
        I know that Phi Sig is in great hands for the future (and I hope it would, given that I’ve helped choose all of
        you). I am incredibly excited to see what the future holds for all of you as people and for Phi Sig as an
        organization. Continue to be the smart, motivated, layered, incredible souls I know all of you are. You provided
        me a light in my darkness, and I know that you will continue to do so for so many others. Make the most of every
        day. Take moments to breathe, and remember that you are all capable of greatness. Stay up all night talking with
        your friends sometimes, even if there's a lot going on. Hold your friends and family close and always know that
        you are worthy.
    </p>

    <p>
        It has been the honor of my life to serve you as your IT chair, IM/Rec chair, and, finally, Parliamentarian. I
        hope that I have done right by you all and Phi Sig and, along the way, that I perhaps put a smile on some of
        your faces or made some of you laugh. I am the person I am today because I met all of you. I will continue to be
        in the area next year, so please don’t be strangers. If you ever want to reach out to an old man, you can text
        me at (919)-622-5071 for any reason. Please take care of my baby.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's a great quote I found recently:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “Do not be dismayed by the brokenness of the world. All things break, and all things can be mended, not with
        time, as they say, but with intention. So go. Love intentionally, extravagantly, unconditionally. The broken
        world waits in darkness for the light that is you.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Though this may be the end of my journey at UNC, I will carry you all in my heart forever and I hope that this
        will not conclude our journeys together. I love you all, and as I like to say, my hope that this is not a
        goodbye, but a see you soon.
    </p>
